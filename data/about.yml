- about me:
  name: Nurlan Emir
  description: Entering the path of modern world wizard aka programmer.
                The question is where to begin. I wanted an intense and short
                course where I could work on my soft skills as well such as
                being organized and laser focused on work that matters.
                12-week coding bootcamp was the obvious choice.
                It's week 4 and despite the constant feeling not having much time,
                it feels right at this moment of my life journey.
                I'm looking forward to go deeper in the rabbit hole and
                create applications that bring value to the society I live in.
