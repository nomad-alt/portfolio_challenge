        Entering a path of the modern world wizard aka programmer.
        %br/
        The question was where to begin. I wanted an intense and short
        course where technical skills are interweaving with improving ones soft skills.
        12-week coding bootcamp was the obvious choice.
        It's week 4 and despite the constant feeling not having much time,
        it feels right at this moment of my life journey.
        I'm looking forward to go deeper in the rabbit hole and
        create applications that bring value to the society I live in.
